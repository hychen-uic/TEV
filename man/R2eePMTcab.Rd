\title{Conditional permutation test adjusting for covariates for estimating equation approach}
\usage{
R2eePMTcab(y, x, pa, lam = 0.2, niter = 3, npm = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{outcome}

\item{x}{covariates}

\item{pa}{dimension of covariates to be adjusted}

\item{lam}{parameter adjusting the format of the weighting matrix. Default is 0.2}

\item{niter}{number of iterations for updating lambda. Default is 3}

\item{npm}{Monte Carlo sample size for permutation. Default is 1000}
}
\value{
Output includes the p-values (estimate and bound) of the test,
estimate of proportion of the extra explained variation, and simulation results.
}
\description{
This function performs test of no extra variation explained by the additional covariates by
permuting the additional covariates using the estimating equation approach.
}
\details{
The computation permutes the second part of the covariates and can be computationally slow.
It differs from \code{R2eePMTca} in the way of matrix computation.

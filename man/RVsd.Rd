\title{Estimating equation approach to the proportion of the explained variation with supplementary covariate data}
\usage{
RVsd(
  y,
  x,
  xsup = NULL,
  lam = 1,
  niter = 1,
  alpha = c(0.05),
  know = "no",
  KV = array(0, c(3, 100)),
  nrep = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{outcome: a vector of length n.}

\item{x}{covariates: a matrix of nxp dimension.}

\item{xsup}{supplementary covariates: a matrix of Nxp dimension.
when xsup=NULL and n>p, it performs least-square with the simulation variance estimate}

\item{lam}{parameter for altering the weighting matrix.}

\item{niter}{number of iterations for updating lam.}

\item{alpha}{a vector of type I errors used to generate (1-alpha)confidence intervals.}

\item{know}{if KV is known, options include "yes" and "no". Default is "no".}

\item{KV, }{a matrix with 3 rows and 100 collums corresponding to different lambda values.
the first component of the row vector KV=kappa_1, the second=kappa_2, the third=kappa_3}

\item{nrep}{Monte Carlo sample size for computinging KV.}
}
\value{
Estimate of the proportion of explained variation, variance estimates under normality
and non-normality assumptions, and confidence intervals under normality and non-normality assumptions.
}
\description{
This function computes:
(1). the proportion of the explained variation
(2). The explained variation
adjusting for the correlation in covariates with possible suplementary data
}
\details{
The estimation approach does not assume independent covariates and can deal
with the case \eqn{n\le p}. But require the sample sizes of x and X combined be greater than p.

\title{Conditional permutation test for no extra explained variation by estimating equation approach
with supplementary covariate dat}
\usage{
R2eesdPMTca(y, x, X, pa, lam = 0.2, niter = 3, npm = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{outcome}

\item{x}{covariates}

\item{X}{supplementary covariate data}

\item{pa}{dimension of covariates to be adjusted}

\item{lam}{parameter adjusting the format of the weighting matrix. Default is 0.2}

\item{niter}{number of iteration for updating lambda}

\item{npm}{Monte Carlo sample size for permutation}
}
\value{
Output includes the p-values (estimate and bound) of the test,
estimate of proportion of the extra explained variation, and simulation results.
}
\description{
This function permutes the outcome and uses the estimator for the proportion of
variation explained for performing test of no explained variation.
}
\details{
The algorithm can be slow because the second part of the covariates need to be permuted.

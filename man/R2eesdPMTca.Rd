\title{Conditional permutation test for no extra variation explained using the estimating equation approach with supplemental
data}
\usage{
R2eesdPMTca(y, x, X, pa, lam = 0.1, niter = 1, npm = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{outcome: a vector of length n.}

\item{x}{covariates: a matrix of nxp dimension.}

\item{X}{supplementary covariates: a matrix of Nxp dimension.}

\item{pa}{length of the covariates to be adjusted.}

\item{lam}{parameter adjusting the formation of the weighting matrix. Default is 0.12}

\item{niter}{number of iterations for updating lambda. Default is 3}

\item{npm}{permutation sample size for simulation computation of p-value.}
}
\value{
The p-values (normal approximation, empirical estimate, and bound) of the test, estimate of proportion of
the explained variation for both parts together, the first part alone, and the second part
given the first part, and simulation results.
}
\description{
This method performs permutation test by permuting the second part of the covariates and can be computationally slow.
}
\details{
This method tests no extra variation explained by the second part of covariates
given that the first part of covariates in the model by permuting the second part of
covariates and estimating using the estimating equation approach. P-value is computed
using simulation approach.
